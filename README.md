## Description
Welcome to Horiseon! We wanted to help make finding what users are looking for easier. This was designed to improved accessibility for businesses to learn how their customers are finding them through the web. We were able to add in features that if something doesn't load, you will still be able to access and see what is being described. During this process we were able to learn that when something is more accessible, it makes it easier to navigate through.
